## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers (participants), of WRF-Python pledge to 
make participation in our software project and community a safe, productive, 
welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. All participants are required 
to abide by this Code of Conduct. This includes respectful treatment of 
everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity 
or expression, level of experience, nationality, political affiliation, 
veteran status, pregnancy, genetic information, physical appearance, race, 
religion, or sexual orientation, as well as any other characteristic protected 
under applicable US federal or state law.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respectful when offering and gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Acknowledging the contributions of others
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Treating everyone with respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of 
  views and opinions
* Communicating openly with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than 
  individuals

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
* Personal attacks directed toward other participants
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Inappropriate, negative, derogatory comments and/or attacks on personal 
  beliefs
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic 
  address, without explicit permission
* Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct
* Physical or verbal abuse by anyone to anyone, including but not limited to a 
  participant, member of the public, guest, member of any institution or 
  sponsor
* Comments related to characteristics given in the pledge at the top
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images
* Threatening or stalking other participants
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a 
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Project whether it 
be online or face-to-face. This includes project code, code repository, 
associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and 
wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media 
accounts, and any other forums created by the project team which the community 
uses for communication. In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct 
outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. 
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project 
maintainers.

## Community Responsibilities

Everyone in the community is empowered to respond to people who are showing 
unacceptable behavior. They can talk to them privately or publicly. Anyone 
requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. 
If the behavior continues concerns may be brought to the project 
administrators or to any other party listed in the Reporting section below.

## Project Administrator Responsibilities

Project Administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of 
acceptable behavior and are encouraged to model appropriate behavior and 
provide support when people in the community point out inappropriate behavior. 
Project administrator(s) are normally the ones that would be tasked to carry 
out the actions in the Consequences section below.

Project Administrators are also expected to keep this Code of Conduct updated 
with the main one housed at UCAR as listed below in the Attribution section.

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be brought to the attention of the 
project administrator(s) who may take any action as outlined in the 
Consequences section below. However, making a report to a project 
administrator is not considered an 'official report' to UCAR.

Instances of unacceptable behavior may also be reported directly to UCAR via 
UCAR's Harassment Reporting and Complaint Procedure at [https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/harassment-reporting-and-complaint-procedure](https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/harassment-reporting-and-complaint-procedure), 
or anonymously through UCAR's EthicsPoint Hotline at [https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/ethics/anonymous-reporting](https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/ethics/anonymous-reporting).

Complaints received by UCAR will be handled pursuant to the procedures 
outlined in UCAR's Harassment Reporting and Complaint Procedure. Complaints 
to UCAR will be held as confidential as practicable under the circumstances, 
and retaliation against a person who initiates a complaint or an inquiry about 
inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

Any Contributor can use these reporting methods even if they are not directly 
affiliated with UCAR. The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for reporting 
is here: [https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/reporting-faqs](https://www2.fin.ucar.edu/procedures/hr/reporting-faqs).

## Consequences

Upon receipt of a complaint, the project administrator(s) may take any action 
deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. Such action can 
include things such as: removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, 
code, wiki edits, email, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct, or banning temporarily or permanently any contributor 
for other behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or 
harmful. Project Administrators also have the right to report violations to 
UCAR HR and/or UCAR's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (ODEI) as 
well as a participant's home institution and/or law enforcement. In the event 
an incident is reported to UCAR, UCAR will follow its Harassment Reporting 
and Complaint Procedure.

## Process for Changes

All UCAR managed projects are required to adopt this Contributor Code of 
Conduct. Adoption is assumed even if not expressly stated in the repository. 
Projects should fill in sections where prompted with project-specific 
information, including, project name, email addresses, adoption date, etc. 
There is one section below marked "optional" that may not apply to a given 
project.

Projects that adopt this Code of Conduct need to stay up to date with 
UCAR's Contributor Code of Conduct, linked with a DOI in the "Attribution" 
section below. Projects can make limited substantive changes to the Code of 
Conduct, however, the changes must be limited in scope and may not contradict 
the UCAR Contributor Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct was originally adapted from the Contributor Covenant, 
version 1.4, available at [Contributor-Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4). 
We then aligned it with the UCAR Participant Code of Conduct, which also 
borrows from the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Code of Conduct. The UCAR 
Participant Code of Conduct applies to both UCAR employees as well as 
participants in activities run by UCAR. We modified the "scope" section with 
the django project description, and we added "Publication Ethics" from 
the NGEET/FATES project. The original version of this for all software 
projects that have strong management from UCAR or UCAR staff is available 
on the UCAR website at [*Enter DOI link name*] (the date that it was adopted 
by this project was [*Enter date adopted*]). When responding to complaints 
UCAR HR and ODEI will do so based on the latest published version. Therefore, 
any project-specific changes should follow the Process for Changes section 
above.

## Publication Ethics (optional)

We aim to create an open development environment where developers can be 
confident that all members of the community are publishing any research 
on the project in an ethical manner. In particular, writing code is a form of 
intellectual contribution, and one should expect that all such intellectual 
contributions are respected and given credit in any resulting published work. 
To support the community and avoid issues of misconduct related to the above 
principle, please respect the following rules:

* Document the version of the code used in any publication, preferably by 
  either using a release tag (existing or newly created) if possible, or a 
  commit hash if not.

* Do not use code from anywhere other than the central project's development 
  repository main development branch without discussing with the author(s) of 
  the modified code your intentions for using the code and receiving their 
  permission to do so.

* When using project features that have recently been integrated into the 
  central Project development repository, be mindful of the contributions 
  of others and, where the novel features qualitatively affect the results, 
  involve the author(s) of these features in any resulting manuscripts. 
  Be particularly aware of the concerns of early career researchers, and 
  ensure they have sufficient time to lead publications using their 
  developments.

* When discussing results arising from older project features that have been 
described in the literature or releases, accurately cite the publications 
describing those features or releases.
