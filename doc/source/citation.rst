How to cite WRF-Python
-----------------------

If you use this software, please cite it as described below:

WRF-Python has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a persistent identifier for
web-based resources. The benefit of DOIs is that they are widely accepted by academic publishers
as citable locators for scholarly objects. The WRF-Python DOI, when used in URL form,
`https://doi.org/10.5065/D6W094P1 <https://doi.org/10.5065/D6W094P1>`_, provides a persistent link
to the WRF-Python GitHub repository, and can be used to cite the WRF-Python project as a whole.

In addition, each WRF-Python version is assigned a separate DOI to allow users to access older
releases. This ensures that users are not only able to cite the specific software version through
DOIs but are also able to download & use the corresponding release for reproducibility purposes.

If you would like to cite WRF-Python as a whole (without referring to a specific version), use
the following text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2017).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: WRF-Python [Software].
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/D6W094P1.**

Instead, if you would like to cite a specific version of WRF-Python, use the following text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: WRF-Python (v\<version\>) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:\<DOI\>.**

In the above citation text, update the year, WRF-Python version, and DOI as appropriate. For
example:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2022).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: WRF-Python (v1.3.4.1) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6685115.**

Please find DOIs for all the WRF-Python versions `here
<https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=conceptrecid:%226685091%22&sort=-version&all_versions=True>`_.

Please note: The DOI minting service, Zenodo, might be suggesting their own citation text (as
they are the publisher of such DOIs) in their website. We prefer the text we recommend here to be used;
however, either way is acceptable.
